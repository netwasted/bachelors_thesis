# Detecting Key Genes Associated With Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Immunotherapy Resistance

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly malignant type of kidney
cancer associated with poor prognosis. This disease is extremely difficult to treat
due to its chemo- and radiotherapy resistance. Despite several novel methods of
immunotherapy, a high percentage of patients does not respond to it. In order
to discover mechanisms of treatment resistance and therefore to choose the ap-
propriate therapy for a particular patient, it is highly important to investigate all
possible reasons. One of the perspective methods is detecting key genes - a group
of genes with the highest impact on the immunotherapy failure. The present work
is aimed at searching and studying such genes by bioinformatics analysis, which
consists of differential expression and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, clustering,
building linear prognostic model and investigating biological processes associated
with the found genes.
